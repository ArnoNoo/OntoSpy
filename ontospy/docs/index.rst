Welcome to OntoSPy's documentation!
===================================

OntoSPy is an RDFLIb-based Python toolkit for inspecting ontologies on the Semantic Web.

OntosPy allows you to extract all the schema information from an RDFS/OWL ontology, inspect it and use it query a corresponding knowledge base. 

The basic worflow is simple: load an ontology by instantiating the ``Ontology`` class; you get back an object that lets you interrogate the RDFS/OWL schema. That's all!

Ps: the library can be used in standalone mode too.
