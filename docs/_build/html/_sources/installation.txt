Installation
===================================

Prerequisites
--------------
- Python (untested on v3)
- A python package manager: `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.


Installation: 
--------------

**Web (recommended):**

	Once you have a package manager installed, get OntoSPy from the Python Package Index: 
	
	``easy_install ontospy`` or ``pip install ontospy``
	
	The python library, its dependencies and all of its command-line executables will be installed. 

**Manual**:

	Get the source code from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontosPy>`_ , then run:

	``python setup.py install``


Dependencies

OntoSPy couldn't exist without the following libraries. 

- `rdflib <https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib>`_
- `colorama <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama>`_
- `readline <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/readline>`_
- `django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
- `github3 <https://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/master/>`_
