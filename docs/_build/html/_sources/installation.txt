Installation
===================================

Prerequisites

- Python (tested on 2.x or 3.x)
- A python package manager: `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.


Installation:

Once you have a package manager installed, get OntoSpy from the Python Package Index:
