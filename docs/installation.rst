Installation
===================================

Prerequisites
--------------
- Python (2.x and 3.x)
- A python package manager: `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.


Installation: 
--------------

Once you have a package manager installed, get OntoSpy from the Python Package Index: 

``easy_install ontospy`` or ``pip install ontospy``

The python library, its dependencies and all of its command-line executables will be installed. 

Note: if you're upgrading from an older version, make sure you use the -U flag:

``pip install ontospy -U``


Dependencies
--------------
OntoSpy couldn't exist without the following libraries. 

- `rdflib <https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib>`_
- `colorama <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama>`_

- `django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
- `github3 <https://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/master/>`_
